## Latest Project: Airflow Showcase on macOS M2 March-01-2025

### Overview
- **Installation & Environment:**  
  I installed Apache Airflow on my Mac laptop (M2) and encountered some conflicts due to OS compatibility issues. After troubleshooting, I discovered a recommended OS version to resolve these issues (more details coming soon).



- **Setup & Functionality:**  
  Airflow is now successfully running with both the web interface and scheduler enabled. The demo DAG is configured to execute every hour, showcasing a robust and dynamic data pipeline.

- **Highlights:**  
  - Fully functional Airflow web UI for monitoring tasks  
  - Scheduled DAG runs every hour to simulate continuous processing  
  - OS recommendation notes to overcome M2 conflicts (to be detailed in future updates)
